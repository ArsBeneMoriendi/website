            <h1>In the world of GAFAM</h1>
            <time>August 13, 2023</time>
            <p>
                GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) is known by their top-tier services, and they are mostly free. So, you may think that they make income from ads
                or paid products. And that&apos;s partially true. In the real world they profile you and they share that data with other companies in exchange for, as you might
                think, money.
            </p>

                Google filters your search results and YouTube recommendations to analyze your reaction and confine you to it&apos;s filter bubble. That allow them to show you
                content you are comfortable with and content that you can watch all the time. By that, they make even more money from ads because you keep watching those YouTube
                videos as they are &quot;interesting&quot; to you. Google keeps tracking you everywhere, even beyond their websites by using advanced digital fingerprinting and
                resources that most of the websites pull from Google such as Google Ads, Google Analytics or Google Fonts. They know what you are buying, they know what you are
                watching, what sites you visit. They use it to profile you even more and display you way more personalized ads which finally leads to that you click on those ads.
                Well, there is a chance that it won&apos;t succeed. That&apos;s why they sell data they gathered to third-parties so their partners can give a try.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have an iOS or Android smartphone, Apple and Google track, collect and analyze your location without telling you or giving you a choice. They use that to
                provide you more personalized ads about places you&apos;ve been to or you have walked by. They sell that data to their third-parties or for example insurance
                companies so they know that you&apos;ve been to doctor 3 times this month and because of that they won&apos;t give you insurance.
            </p>

                Facebook selects the contents of your newsfeed to analyze your reactions and confine you to it&apos;s filter bubble so you can browse Facebook non-stop and by that
                give more data to Facebook. They know how long you are looking for one post, they know when you like it, they know when you view the image gallery of the post. They
                know everything that you do on their platform. Then, they sell that to third-parties or/and use it for their own business by selecting you specific ads about
                products you want. Not only that, Facebook knows who you sleep with, where you go on Mondays morning and they even scan your contacts and pull them to their
                database to profile Facebook users even more or reveal the true identity of a Facebook user that did not provide their real name. Facebook keeps tracking you
                everywhere on the Internet, and keeps tracking your friends with your help.

                Analyzed on a sufficient scale, behaviors that might seem trivial can reveal a lot about your personality, your expectations and your peers. That&apos;s what Amazon
                does with data that you provide them by using their services. They use it to provide you products that they think you might buy, they sell it out to other
                companies.
            </p>

                Microsoft is buying it&apos;s way into schools and universities by striking deals to train teachers and students. Kids use their products every day and by that they
                get more comfortable with that so when they are going to leave the school there is a big chance that they will buy Microsoft Office or Microsoft Windows because
                they don&apos;t know how to use different ones or they are scared. It is a big opportunity for them to manipulate kid&apos;s minds.
            </p>
            <p>
                With all that data combined, companies know everything about you and by using their services you keep the water of your data running. Which leads to manipulation,
                information bubble, unintended products getting bought by you.

                And at the end of the day you would ask if there is any replacement for GAFAM. And well, there is. And they not only say they do not collect data nor profile you.
