                We serve (mostly) free and open-source services. We do not track nor sell user&apos;s data to third-parties. We keep our services simple, without requests to Google
                or Facebook. We do not use tracking pixel, fingerprinting. We do not profile our user&apos;s.
            </p>

                We use Cloudflare (pending change) to connect you with our servers. The connection is not proxied by Cloudflare servers, so you connect directly with us. That means
                Cloudflare is not able to collect any data about the traffic.
