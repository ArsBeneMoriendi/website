            <p>
                We serve (mostly) free and open-source services. We do not track nor sell user&apos;s data to third-parties. We keep our services simple, without requests to Google
                or Facebook. We do not use tracking pixel, fingerprinting. We do not profile our user&apos;s.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use Cloudflare (pending change) to connect you with our servers. The connection is not proxied through Cloudflare servers, so you connect directly with us. That
                means Cloudflare is not able to collect any data about the traffic and they are only our authoritative name servers, which as mentioned earlier is changing soon to
                protect privacy of our users.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are currently in the beta stage, so if you want to delete your account data please reach out to us through mail. All your data will be deleted as fast as
                possible and as smooth as possible. This will change in the future.
            </p>
